## Lab 1: Price Matching Using Tool Calling 

In this lab, we'll use Confluent Cloud's Apache Flink tool calling feature to look up products in real-time orders. The LLM, through tool calling, uses a Zapier MCP server to retrieve competitor prices, and if a competitor offers a better price, the agent automatically applies a price match.

### Connecting to Flink

Confluent Cloud Flink Compute Pool is a managed environment that provides the resources needed to run Apache Flink jobs directly within Confluent Cloud. It eliminates the need for self-managed Flink clusters by offering a scalable, serverless compute layer for stream processing and real-time analytics on data in Confluent topics.

In [Flink UI](https://confluent.cloud/go/flink), choose the Environment. 

You will see a compute pool created for you. Click on **Open SQL Workspace**

### Agent 1: URL Scraping Agent

First, we need to enrich incoming Orders with product names, then search for and scrape these products from competitorsâ€™ websites. Weâ€™ll achieve this using Flinkâ€™s Tool Calling feature, which will enable Flink to invoke the Zapier MCP server we previously created.

![Agent 1: Price matching agent](../assets/lab1/agent1-diagram.png)

In the Flink workspace, register the model and bind the tool to it in the Confluent catalog:

> **Note:**  
> If you changed the `prefix`, retrieve the updated query from `mcp_commands.txt` in the Terraform directory.  
> The example below uses Amazon Bedrock.

```sql
  CREATE MODEL `zapier_mcp_model`
  INPUT (prompt STRING)
  OUTPUT (response STRING)
  WITH (
    'provider' = 'bedrock',
    'task' = 'text_generation',
    'bedrock.connection' = 'streaming-agents-bedrock-connection',
    'bedrock.params.max_tokens' = '20000',
    'mcp.connection' = 'zapier-mcp-connection'
  );
```

Run this in Flink Workspace UI to start the first agent:

```sql
-- Get recent orders, scrape competitor website for same product
SET 'sql.state-ttl' = '1 HOURS';
CREATE TABLE recent_orders_scraped AS
SELECT
    o.order_id,
    p.product_name,
    c.customer_email,
    o.price as order_price,
    (AI_TOOL_INVOKE(
        'zapier_mcp_model', 
        CONCAT('Use the webhooks_by_zapier_get tool to extract page contents. ',
               'Instructions: Extract the page contents from the following URL: ',
               'https://www.walmart.com/search?q="', 
               p.product_name, '"'),
        MAP[],
        MAP['webhooks_by_zapier_get', 'Fire off a single GET request with optional querystrings.'],
        MAP['debug', 'true', 'on_error', 'continue']
    ))['webhooks_by_zapier_get']['response'] as page_content
FROM orders o
JOIN customers c ON o.customer_id = c.customer_id  
JOIN products p ON o.product_id = p.product_id;
```

This agent uses the `product_name` as an input to URL scraping tool. The output is the `page_content` of the same product on the competitor website.

### Agent 2: Price Extractor Agent

Agent 2 will take `recent_orders_scraped` topic as an input and extract the competitor price from the `page_content` field.

![Agent 2: Price extractor agent](../assets/lab1/agent2-diagram.png)

In Flink workspace, register the model for Agent 2 in Confluent catalog:

> **Note:**  
> If you changed the `prefix`, retrieve the updated query from `mcp_commands.txt` in the Terraform directory.  
> The example below uses Amazon Bedrock.

```sql
  CREATE MODEL `llm_textgen_model`
  INPUT (prompt STRING)
  OUTPUT (response STRING)
  WITH(
    'provider' = 'bedrock',
    'task' = 'text_generation',
    'bedrock.connection' = 'jhines-streaming-agents-bedrock-connection',
    'bedrock.params.max_tokens' = '20000'
  );
```

Start **Agent 2** to extract the competitorâ€™s price from `page_content` and output it as a new field: `extracted_price`.

```sql
-- Extract prices from scraped webpages using AI_COMPLETE
CREATE TABLE streaming_competitor_prices AS
SELECT
    ros.order_id,
    ros.product_name,
    ros.customer_email,
    ros.order_price,
    llm.response as extracted_price
FROM recent_orders_scraped ros
CROSS JOIN LATERAL TABLE(
    AI_COMPLETE('llm_textgen_model', 
        CONCAT('Analyze this search results page for the following product name: "', ros.product_name, 
               '", and extract the price of the product that most closely matches the product name. ',
               'Return only the price in format: XX.XX. For example, return only: 29.95. ',
               'Page content: ', ros.page_content)
    )
) AS llm
WHERE ros.page_content IS NOT NULL 
  AND ros.page_content NOT LIKE 'MCP error%'
  AND ros.page_content <> '';
```


In a new cell, check the output of `streaming_competitor_prices`

```sql
SELECT * FROM streaming_competitor_prices;
```

![Agent 2 Output Screenshot](../assets/lab1/agent2-flinkoutput.png)

Notice the new field `extracted_price`. This will be used by the next Agent.


### Agent 3: Price Match Notification Agent

In this step, weâ€™ll notify the customer when a price match has been applied.  
Weâ€™ll again use Confluent Cloudâ€™s tool-calling feature â€” this time connecting to the Zapier MCP server to trigger an email or message to the customer.

![Agent 3: Price Match Notification Agent](../assets/lab1/agent3-diagram.png)

We donâ€™t need to register a new model here. Instead, weâ€™ll reuse the one from Agent 1, since both agents use the same Zapier MCP server and share the same tools.  For this agent, the tool is `gmail_send_email`.

Start Agent 3 by running:

```sql
-- Create and send professional email notifications for price matches
CREATE TABLE price_match_email_results AS
SELECT
    scp.order_id,
    scp.customer_email,
    scp.product_name,
    CAST(CAST(scp.order_price AS DECIMAL(10, 2)) AS STRING) as order_price,
    CAST(CAST(scp.competitor_price AS DECIMAL(10, 2)) AS STRING) as competitor_price,
    CAST(CAST((scp.order_price - scp.competitor_price) AS DECIMAL(10, 2)) AS STRING) as savings,
    AI_TOOL_INVOKE('zapier_mcp_model', 
                   CONCAT('Use the gmail_send_email tool to send an email. ',
                          'Instructions: send yourself an email to your own email address, ',
                          'subject "âœ… Great News! Price Match Applied - Order #', scp.order_id, '", ',
                          'body "Subject: Your Price Match Has Been Applied - Order #', scp.order_id, '
